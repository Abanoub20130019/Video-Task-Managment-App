# Security Guidelines

## Critical Security Fixes Applied

This document outlines the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed to resolve Google's "dangerous site" warning.

### üö® Critical Issues Fixed

1. **Unprotected Debug Endpoints**
   - **Issue**: `/api/debug` and `/api/debug-env` exposed sensitive database information without authentication
   - **Fix**: Added authentication requirements and disabled in production
   - **Impact**: Prevented information disclosure attacks

2. **Hardcoded Admin Credentials**
   - **Issue**: `/api/fix-admin` contained hardcoded admin password in source code
   - **Fix**: Completely disabled the endpoint
   - **Impact**: Eliminated credential exposure vulnerability

3. **Weak Content Security Policy**
   - **Issue**: CSP allowed `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` which enables XSS attacks
   - **Fix**: Removed unsafe directives and added additional security headers
   - **Impact**: Prevented XSS and code injection attacks

4. **Information Disclosure in Logs**
   - **Issue**: Authentication functions logged sensitive password data
   - **Fix**: Removed debug logging that exposed sensitive information
   - **Impact**: Prevented credential leakage in logs

### üõ°Ô∏è Security Headers Added

- `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: off`
- `X-Download-Options: noopen`
- `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies: none`
- `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`
- `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`
- `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin`

### üîí Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - All sensitive endpoints require authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) implemented
   - Rate limiting on authentication endpoints

2. **Input Validation**
   - Zod schemas for all API inputs
   - SQL injection prevention through Mongoose ODM
   - XSS prevention through input sanitization

3. **Environment Security**
   - Debug endpoints disabled in production
   - Sensitive data removed from logs
   - Environment variables properly configured

## Deployment Security Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] All environment variables are set securely
- [ ] `NODE_ENV=production` is set
- [ ] `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is a strong, unique value
- [ ] Database credentials are secure and rotated
- [ ] SSL/TLS certificates are valid
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are configured

## Security Monitoring

### What to Monitor

1. **Failed Authentication Attempts**
   - Multiple failed login attempts from same IP
   - Brute force attack patterns

2. **Unusual API Usage**
   - High request rates
   - Requests to non-existent endpoints
   - Requests with malicious payloads

3. **Database Access**
   - Unusual query patterns
   - Failed database connections
   - Data modification outside normal hours

### Incident Response

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Block suspicious IP addresses
   - Rotate compromised credentials
   - Review access logs

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze attack vectors
   - Assess data exposure
   - Document findings

3. **Recovery**
   - Apply security patches
   - Update security policies
   - Notify stakeholders if required

## Regular Security Tasks

### Weekly
- Review access logs for anomalies
- Check for failed authentication attempts
- Monitor rate limiting effectiveness

### Monthly
- Update dependencies with security patches
- Review and rotate API keys
- Audit user permissions

### Quarterly
- Conduct security assessment
- Review and update security policies
- Test incident response procedures

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. Email security concerns to: [your-security-email]
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for response before disclosure
